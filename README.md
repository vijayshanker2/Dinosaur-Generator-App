# Dinosaur-Generator-App

I'm building a basic web app using Node.js (Express.js) loading external API data using asynchronous JavaScript.

APIs from RAPID API
Dino Ipsum: lorem ipsum for dinosaur lovers and anyone who needs meaningless filler text for prototyping web pages.
Bing Image Search: AI service from Microsoft Azure that turns any app into an image search resource.
